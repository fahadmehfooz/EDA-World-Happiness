* The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll .
* The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors which are: economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity – contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world’s lowest national averages for each of the six factors.
*  They have no impact on the total score reported for each country, but they do explain why some countries rank higher than others.

## Data Wrangling  And Visualizations
*  Checked for columns with high correlation using a heatmap.
*  Grouped the columns on the basis of geographical areas.
*  Checked for skewness using displots.
* Plotting relplots, boxplots, barplots and kdeplots for the features.
